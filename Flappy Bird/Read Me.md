# Flappy Bird!

Yes, this is the game that we all were addicted to back in 2013. This is a clone of the beloved flappy bird but written in python.

The score keeping mechanism is still a bit buggy because it doesn't count exactly til the bird passes the pipes. It counts sometimes
slightly before or slightly after. I am working on another solution to that problem. 

One minor issue with graphics is that I coded a way to flip the pipes if they are on the top or bottom, but there is one specific
height where this does not happen. It occurs rarely but I will figure out and update the list when I do figure out that height.
