# py-projects

Just some projects I have been working on and will continually add-to or make more! 
Most of these projects are just for my learning experience and experimentation. Feel free to recommend me more projects! 

I have found ideas for these projects from the internet. The skills used in these projects are skills that are relavent in most 
positions that are related to: software engineering, data analytics, big data developer, database manager, financial analyst etc. 

I think projects on your own show interest in the topic at hand and interest to learn more about code/tech that is new and upcoming.
In a world where tech evolves very fast, it is important to stay on top of your game and continally evolve with the technology. 

I have another stock related project in the works, but due to sensitive information I have withhold that project for now. Until I finish, 
it will not be uploaded.
