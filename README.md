# py-projects

Just some projects I have been working on this summer and will continually add-to or make more! 
Most of these projects are just for my learning experience and experimentation. Feel free to recommend me more projects! 

I have found ideas for these projects from the internet. The skills used in these projects are skills that are relavent in most 
positions that are related to: software engineering, data analytics, big data developer, database manager, financial analyst etc. 

I think projects on your own show interest in the topic at hand and interest to learn more about code/tech that is upcoming.
In a world where tech evolves very fast, it is important to stay on top of your game and continually evolve with the technology. 

I have another stock related project in the works, but due to sensitive information I have withhold that project for now. Until I finish, 
it will not be uploaded. 

### Finance Analytics: 

Contains projects that have to deal with financial analytics such as stock price analytics and predictive analytics. 
Another project contains sentiment analysis of finance articles for given tickers. 
TSLA.csv is used in this folder. 

### Twitter Streaming and Analytics: 

Twitter scraper bot that collects data based off 3 user inputed keys. 
Twitter analytics bot that displayes how many times each keyword was displayed and in which country was the keyword the most popular. 

### Weather App: 

This contains the code for a weather application that uses real time data to show the current weather in a users area.
The user will input the zip code and weather for taht area will be displayed. 

### Linear Regression: 

This is code for a simple linear regression model. There is already stock data inside, and using matplotlib, I have created a GUI where user can enter interest rate and unemployment rate to get the predicted stock price. 

### COVID_data_map: 

This project takes in current covid data from the Johns Hopkins Github repository. Then, using this data, I followed a tutorial 
that showed me how to visualize this data as a graph that shades in areas that have the most covid cases active over time. In simpler 
words, it is a dynamic world map that shades in countries that have the most covid cases. For example, US is the darkest shade because 
the US has the most cases. 

### Lyrics Bot:

This project is a bot that sends imessages of a lyrics.txt file to someone. I took the idea from TikTok trends of people spamming their friends with lyrics from a song or the full script of the bee movie by using this python code.

### Roll The Dice 

Simple GUI using tkinter that rolls the dice for you. Exploring more into front-end development.
