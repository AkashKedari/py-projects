# Akash Kedari, Object Oriented Programming Section 1 , September 14th 2020
# Assignment 1 - Problem 1 

# Create four variables that store the following information 
# Variable 1 is the class name, ex: Intro to Computer Programs
className = "Object Oriented Programming Fall 2020"

# Variable 2 : Test 1 score: Store 95 
test_1_score = 95

# Variable 3 : Test 2 score: Store 76 
test_2_score = 76

# Variable 4 : Test 3 score: Store 87 
test_3_score = 87

# Calculate the average 
average_test_scores = ((test_1_score + test_2_score + test_3_score)/3)
print("These are the averages of Test 1, 2, 3 for the class: "+className)
# cast type int of average_test_scores to type string so that we can output that value with the string in quotes
print("The overall test average is: "+str(average_test_scores)+"%")
# print("The overall test average is:",average_test_scores,"%")

# You can use the other print statement as well, but how I learned python, I was told it is better to 
# typecast in a formal coding enviornment.
# If I need to change that for this class, please do let me know!
